# Freemius Button

The Freemius Button allows you to add Freemius Checkout to any button of your WordPress content using the block editor.

## Overview

The Freemius Button extends the core Button block with Freemius Checkout functionality. When enabled, clicking the button will open the Freemius Checkout popup to process payments.

## Configuration Scopes

The button settings can be configured at three different scopes:

1. **Global** - Settings that apply site-wide
2. **Page** - Settings that apply to the current page/post
3. **Button** - Settings specific to the individual button

Settings cascade down from global to button level, with more specific scopes overriding broader ones.

## Key Settings

- **Product ID** - Your Freemius product ID (required)
- **Public Key** - Your Freemius public key (required)
- **Plan ID** - Specific plan to offer
- **Pricing ID** - Specific pricing to offer
- **Billing Cycle** - Default billing cycle (monthly/annual)
- **Currency** - Transaction currency
- **Quantity** - Default quantity

- **Success URL** - Redirect URL after successful purchase
- **Cancel URL** - Redirect URL after cancellation

Please refer to the [Freemius documentation](https://freemius.com/help/documentation/) for more information on these settings.

## Customization

The button appearance can be customized using the standard WordPress button block settings for:

- Colors

## Events & Callbacks

You can add custom JavaScript code to handle various checkout events:

- `purchaseCompleted` - Called after successful purchase
